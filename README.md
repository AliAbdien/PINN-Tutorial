# ðŸ”¬ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with PyTorch

This repository demonstrates how to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), implemented in PyTorch.

## ðŸ“˜ What are PINNs?

Physics-Informed Neural Networks integrate physical laws into the training of neural networks, allowing them to solve PDEs using both data and governing equations.

## ðŸ§  Example: Burgers' Equation

We solve the 1D nonlinear Burgers' equation:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\]
